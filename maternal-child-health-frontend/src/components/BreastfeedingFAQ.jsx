        question: "Is it normal for breastfeeding to hurt?",
        answer: "Breastfeeding should not be painful. Discomfort may occur in the early days, but persistent pain often signals poor latch or positioning. Seek help from a lactation consultant or La Leche League SA.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I breastfeed if I have HIV?",
        answer: "In South Africa, HIV-positive mothers on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are encouraged to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months. ART significantly reduces transmission risk. Always follow your clinic‚Äôs guidance.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is formula better if I‚Äôm not producing enough milk?",
        answer: "Most mothers produce enough milk. Frequent feeding, skin-to-skin contact, and proper latch help boost supply. Formula may be necessary in some cases, but consult a health worker before deciding.",
    },
    {
        question: "Should I stop breastfeeding if I get sick?",
        answer: "Most common illnesses (like colds or flu) do not require stopping. In fact, your breastmilk contains antibodies that help protect your baby. Only stop if advised by a healthcare provider.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is it okay to breastfeed in public?",
        answer: "South African law protects your right to breastfeed anywhere. It‚Äôs natural, legal, and essential for your baby‚Äôs health. You don‚Äôt need permission.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I drink rooibos or herbal teas while breastfeeding?",
        answer: "Rooibos is generally safe and caffeine-free. However, some herbal teas may affect milk supply or baby‚Äôs digestion. Always check with a health professional before using herbal remedies.",
