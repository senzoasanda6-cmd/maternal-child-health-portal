## Security

-   Ensure all health data is encrypted in the database.
-   Secure the API with JWT tokens.
-   Implement role-based access control (mothers can see their own data, healthcare providers can access assigned patients).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

For developer notes about clearing caches after changing middleware or the HTTP kernel, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Developer helpers

Quick helper scripts are provided at the repository root to simplify common developer tasks: clearing and rebuilding Laravel caches, regenerating Composer autoload, and running the test suite. See `REBUILD_AND_TEST.md` for full details.

- Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
# clear caches and run tests
.\rebuild_and_test.ps1

# clear/rebuild caches and run tests
.\rebuild_and_test.ps1 -RebuildCaches
```

- macOS / Linux (Bash):

```bash
# clear caches and run tests
./rebuild_and_test.sh

# clear/rebuild caches and run tests
./rebuild_and_test.sh --rebuild-caches
```

If you run the application in a persistent process (e.g. Octane, Swoole, Docker, IIS), restart the process after running these scripts so changes are picked up by worker processes.
